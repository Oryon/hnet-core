These could be written to some sort of automated testcases at some point..

- does not blow up with e.g. elsa14 topology
 - disrupt* bird9 => primary route goes down
 - disrupt* bird3 => secondary route goes down
 - restart eth0 on bird9 => primary route should go back up
 - restore* bird9 => primary route goes down, but more brutally

disrupt*
- kill downstream interfaces (ifconfig down)
- kill upstream interfaces (ifconfig down)
- kill -9 bird6

restore
- restore {up,down}stream interfaces (ifconfig up)
- restart bird6
