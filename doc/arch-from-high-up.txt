Very brief overview of how the stuff works on OpenWRT:

[1] /etc/init/hnet 

 - stops conflicting services (there's list of them)

 - fires up pm.lua (main logic daemon) + bird6-elsa (BIRD variant which
   runs Lua based prefix assignment stuff on top of OSPF).

[2] per-interface, pm.lua fires up odhcp6c (our variant, with support for
prefix classes)

 - and odhcp6c calls eventually odhcp6c-handler.lua, which publishes the
 information, when PD prefix state changes (becomes available etc)

[3] bird6-elsa assigns /64 prefixes from usable prefixes (learned via PD,
generated as ULA, IPv4 10.*/8), and publishes it to system state

[4] pm.lua sets up system state to match the worldview bird6-elsa wants

 - IPv4 DHCP client running on every external interface (interface is
   learned to be external when it gets prefix via PD, currently)

 - starts/stops bird4

 - hnet-dnsmasq running on every internal interface

 - appopriate IPv6 addresses on each interface

 - source routing

 - .. and probably bunch more other things, see pm_*.lua, and openwrt/*.sh
   that they invoke in hnet-core repository ( which is at
   https://github.com/fingon/hnet-core ). Note that some of them are
   mutually exclusive, such as using dnsmasq and radvd for router
   advertisements. (or ISC dhclient v6 <> odhcp6c, or ISC dhcpd <>
   dnsmasq).
