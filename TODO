* Bugs to fix

** Why address assignments are not constant?

- should make sure nothing uses non-hash-seeded randomness

* Things to do

** Convert to use ULA always?

** Demo topology?

[ - IETF v6? (/x?) ]

ISP-CPE-N
- HE tunnel (/48)
- DHCPv6 PD server (delegating /56s from /48)

via DHCP, provide Google DNS server address

** Compile for Buffalo, get it working there

- write scripts (using Python telnetlib) to produce ~desired router config
  from scratch

Plan B: Change OpenWRT installation s.t. luasocket is default, and so is
patches BIRD

~howto

.. need also iproute2 package ..
+ homenet-feed (feeds.conf add)
+ prefer it (scripts/feeds install -p homenet)
+ install bird6

=> by default included

- scripts 
 - fire up both bird6 + pm with valid config
 - fire up ISC DHCPv6 PD client with appropriate script

=> zero-conf(!)

What's needed to get the getup on real Buffalo as opposed to OpenWRT?

- image with binaries
 + ISC DHCP (v4, v6)
 + Babel
 + bird6-elsa

- files/ with configuration
 also the Lua stuff + shell script helpers 
 (these should move to a separate package at some point)

- local_setup.sh which prepares ground

- rc.local

** Comprehensively test PA alg (2/2)

- think more corner cases to test

* Things to do if I have time (hah)

** Convert the hnet Lua stuff to a single package-formatted thing

** Package hnet package for OpenWRT

- also have dependency on bird6-elsa, do all the relevant init scripts etc
=> ~plug-n-play

** Next-hop management in pm.lua

DHCPv6 case - the next-hop router _may_ change, for various reasons, and
now the internet connectivity stays down until DHCPv6 PD lease expires


** Cleanup BIRD changes

- whitespace?
+ works with, without lua? with ipv6, without ipv6?
 - should automate these tests

** Optimize memory usage

- there's ~300kb of static stuff that isn't really needed in the LSA/etc

.. but that's peanuts, 32MB router image ran out of memory when running
primitive topology(!).. by default ~40MB used. OMG :p

** Optimize PA alg

*** Profile it (no premature optimizations)

*** Make sure computational complexity of all ops is minimal

pa.asp lookups - now use rid as key

- iid natural index - used in prefix assignment algorithm (run_if_usp)

 ! hmmh. iid nonunique though, and rid IS primary key now that I figured
 that rid+iid is the unique key (took me a month but .. :-p) perhaps rid is
 ok?

- prefix should be also index (binary prefix, probably) => conflict resolution
  constant time (check_asp_conflicts)

- rid only relevant for finding own ASPs - we could store them separately
  anyway? (get_local_asp_values)

- usp => asp needed - or some other way (find_assigned)
  given #usp small, not necessary?

pa.usp lookups - now use rid as key

- containing prefix lookup cannot be optimized (or probably not worth it,
  #usp is small)

*** PA alg - phase 2 - enable incremential mode 

step 1: LSAs changed, IFs changed (? - mostly LSAs in a network should be
stable)

*** PA alg - phase 3 - enable even more incremential mode 

step 2: individual LSA change notifications

(IF changes are hopefully rare enough..)

just get provided with LSA updates




** Document architecture better

- at least what moves, where

- which modules exist

- ...


** Improve DNS support

- provide _stateless_ DHCPv6 and RA DNS server + search domain information

! ISC DHCP P.O.S. does not do stateless stuff at all - needs some state to
  work. Clearly not the option we want to support => at some point have to
  write minimal DHCPv6 server (.. among other things. *sigh*)

.. and stateful stuff is horrible, e.g.

Interface eth1 matches multiple shared networks

(can only have only subnet per interface, it seems)


! rdnssd does not support search domain (even in it's latest
  incarnation). even more stuff I could contirbute to, perhaps..

** DNS with split horizon based on domains

- multihomed, may want to use e.g. cisco.com server X, and for rest Y

** Border detection - DHCPv6 PD integration

Somehow keep probing that DHCPv6 server is present on link.. that may
require luasocket w/ v6?

!!! fairly broken that we have to use SLAAC to get default route on
    interface; also making sure it stays valid is awkward.. and should make
    sure it's not one of the OSPF talking nodes somehow (...)

I suppose we can play with ND to make sure it stays there (and therefore
DHCPv6 solicit flooding isn't really neccessary?)

*** Which DHCPv6 PD to use?

- ISC has huge dependencies and is big

- dnsmasq too integrated with dnsmasq

 <2k LoC

- udhcp in busybox seems bit broken

 <2k LoC

.. just implement the state machine in SMC, make it a public reference, 


** Write ~Pythonic key handling to mst. data structures

- requires ~Pythonia equality function


- API-wise, should look like current one

- except, accept tables and other arbitrary structures as keys and compare
  them 'correctly' (now, has to be same table instance for it to work,
  which is unfortunate)


** 6rd sunsetting

right now probably won't work correctly due to ignoring preferences; but
does anyone care :p

.. to do: write testcase which has 6rd+native with same assigned prefix,
and make sure result is sane

* Done (29.10.+)

** Why radvd doesn't stay up? Or does someone kill it?

- seems like it wasn't happy about nonexistent configs at least => making
  sure we have valid config seems to have alleviated the problem a bit

- PD <> hnet integration is again bit questionable; we _really_ need NH
  maintenance

! /var non-symlink = big issue on owrt, it seems..

** IPv4 support

What does it _mean_? RFC 1918 space allocation, pick _one_ random prefix,
NAT outbound stuff. Try to avoid detectable conflicts.

*** Who originates v4-ULA?

- whoever has highest combination of (configured, rid)

=> configured overrides rid, rid used as tie-breaker

- if not configured, ULA-like behavior

 - try for unique-ish based on v4-upstream's (SHOULD)

  [ can publish the upstream addresses to make the choice sensible ]

**** DIFFERENCE to ULA

- we want to have this setup regardless of existing v4 connectivity

- BUT we want to know about potential conflicts in the DHCP'd addresses

*** What payloads we need?

v4-ULA

- the internal address we use

v4-upstream (SHOULD)

- egress links' assigned addresses

(used to make ULA separate from them, if possible)

v4-ASP

- like v6 ASP

v4-AA

- assigned addresses (to the routers)

*** USP scheme

Just use 10.Y.X.0, or 192.168.X.0

Y = random number picked by whoever provides the route (v4-ULA message)

X = assigned subnet # (if someone has more than 255 networks in their home
running v4, oh well; we can alternatively use Y space also for X if that's
better model, but this one works with CGN that uses 10.* space, with 1/256
chance of failure .. )

*** Crazy idea 2:

Instead of having dedicated v4 payloads, use v6 ones!

/120 ASP
/108-114 USP

and ::ffff:ip base

Pro: 
+ same data structure
+ same algorithms (for most part)

Con: 
- have to deal with variable prefix width
- 3 types of USPs (now 'only' two, ULA and global-ish)

*** How we detect upstream connectivity? [if we want it dynamically anyway]

Simple - run DHCPv4 client _on each interface_, listen for anything that's
NOT from v4-ULA.

=> what's needed:

- DHCPv4 client per interface on box, which publishes results to skv pd-v4.IF
- slightly modified variant of PA alg
- PM needs to configure
 - NAT rule 
 - DHCPv4 server per non-pd-v4.IF 

*** Crazy idea 3

Routers need v4 addresses to function; we can allocate them using the same
'rid trumps' algorithm, from e.g. first /6 of the block (leaving the rest
for DHCPv4 - 64 routers, 192 hosts per subnet)

.. 'owner' responsible for running DHCPv4 server

.. could even sync DHCPv4 state across the 'cloud' for redundancy, but why
bother? DNS discovery?

** Make elsa.lua location configuration option

Hardcoding is bad, mmkay - and if not present, disable the whole thing

** Secondary demo features

~secondary - IPv4

 - need to have IPv4 routing protocol (BIRD?)

 - BIRD not necessarily optimal? 

** IPv4 setup

pieces:

- dhclient with IPv4 _on interfaces with PD
  => potentially detect outside edges of the network

  [ started manually by PM ]

  [ or can be manually configured too, e.g. v4-iflist; pd interfaces are
    just a default ]

  [[ can be also statically configured ]]

- OSPFv3 changes (~pa.lua)

 - v4-ext (external prefixes)

 [ just toss 'em in JSON for the time being.. ]

 ! for the time being skipped

 + v4-usp (configured, prefix) combo => chosen from the router with highest
   (configured, rid) tuple

 [ can be probably normal USP with ~ULA-like behavior, with bit different
 bit length, and extra constraint of it not being in v4-ext lists if not
 manually configured? ]

 ! for the time being, no 'configured' flag

 + v4-asp - assigned from v4-usp

 [ can be probably normal ASP, with different bit length ]

 - v4-asa - assigned addresses on links to routers (rid-based duplicate
   detection/elimination)

 [ JSON contains list 'v4-asa' for a router ]

  addresses have to be globally unique => which link they're attached on
  doesn't matter (but usp-asp mechanism should result in the asp being only
  on single switched network)

- local address assignment on interfaces (IPv4); based on OSPFv3 [ in PM ]

=> changes

+ pm* (v4 address assignment, dhclient running)
 + run dhclient for v4
+ elsa_pa (SKV export, changes to originated LSA)
+ pa (most of the changes)
+ ipv6s (v4-encoding stuff)



* Done (22.10.+)

** Race condition between DHCPv6 PD request, and RADVD setup for ULA

.. if RADVD is set up, we may get our _own_ address back

=> added temporary fix to ip-util, which will use -m option to deal with
that case, and filters own addresses out

(correct solution would be to do ND periodically, and offload the next hop
maintenance to pm.lua)

** Demo features?

+ DHCPv6 PD running on all interfaces

 => ~wan if receive something

+ DNS

 + learn from DHCPv6 PD

 + RA, stateless DHCPv6

- ULA all the time?

(MarkT's keen to test it; I'm still not sure..)

** Aggregate the updates

- _handle_ costly updates via 0-timeout in event loop in single big packets
  [requires bit smarter handling code]

** Add DNS support

+ store them in OSPF?

+ provide out with RA (Linux doesn't really use, I suppose) and DHCPv6
  stateless (trivial config file addition)



** PA alg - phase 1 - invoke only if necessary

pa:should_run() => call pa:run() only if needed
=> major CPU savings in the infra ;) (at least with logging enabled)

** Cleanup BIRD changes

+ works with, without lua? with ipv6, without ipv6?

** Minimize the BIRD changes (now there's still too many leftovers)

* Done (15.10.+)


** Fix 'flakiness'

~500 second+X interval when the connectivity goes down

theory: RA refresh interval _is_ 600; based on looking at logs, 

.. probably addressed it. still, something better is desirable?

use old ifname+nh until new one available; don't remove old if new one not
available!

[approach: don't use kernel RA/default routes => seems to work?]

** Multihoming support

+ requires next-hop finding (from rt.c / process_prefixes can take some
  hints, as it calculates the IPv6 prefix reachability based on the
  advertising router ids - we should do something similar, router id of the
  USP => calculate next hop for that)

 rt.c/ri_install_rt probably more relevant

  ip_addr addr = ipa_from_rid(rid);
  ort *r = (ort *)fib_get(&ospf_area->rtr, &addr, MAX_PREFIX_LENGTH);
  .. fib_find better - returns NULL if non existent
  .. look at r->n->nhs

 [ using topology.[ch] + the leftover ->nhs from the rt.c SPF calculation;
 officially supposed not to work, but it seems to ]


 + add API to elsai to get routes to specific router id's => win(?), and
 use it to produce next hop + ifname to iterate_rid callbacks
   
+ PM should configure skv-published USP+if+nexthop pairs to 'ip rule' table

'ospf-usp' key will contain stuff for ip rule table
 {{prefix=usp-prefix, ifname=ifname, nh=next-hop}, ...}

** Bird crashes sometimes randomly when reloading (...)

Last messages in log:

18-10-2012 09:19:30 <TRACE> MyOSPF: HELLO packet sent via eth2

.. tried to fix it by making reload occur like it does in rest of the code,
that is, in root of event loop.

[fixed?]

** 6RD integration (static WAN)

- just setup the variable using skvtool.lua based on DHCPv6 result

- probably needs gw address 

[multiprovider stuff needs some extra action]

** Refactor callbacks etc. to use tables more

more than one argument => chance to get order wrong (with one, well..)

* Done (8.10.+)

** DHCPv6 PD integration (static WAN)

- just set up the variable using skvtool.lua, and we're golden?

[multiprovider stuff needs some extra action]

** Comprehensively test PA alg

- corner cases (sigh)
 - running out of addrs
 - different conflict situations?

- fixed iid-is-global assumption I made.. (*sigh*)

** PA alg features

*** ULA generation

*** HW addr stuff, duplicate router detection

*** detect RID changes

if OSPF changes RID, we should update it in elsa_pa (and pa)


* Done (1.10.+)

** Make command line tool to inject USPs

skvtool.lua!

** Integrate PA alg, OSPF-ELSA codec, SKV, and rest 

*** pm module (probably should run elsewhere than in OSPF?) [done 05/10]

 maintain local if state according to 'ospf-lap' / 'ospf-usp' changes

 - mutate radvd.conf

 - ip address add/remove

 ospf-usp can be used to control which prefixes we care about, but
 alternative approach is to give control of _all_ assignments to this.

*** wrapper around elsa_pa for elsa.lua [done 04/10]

*** elsa_pa module [done 03/10]

 OSPF => PA

 - provides 'client' interface to pa using elsa + codec

 => ASP, USP information from ELSA + codec decoded OSPFv3 LSAs
 => if information from ELSA

 + data from skv [USP]

 PA => OSPF
 - originates AC payloads using 'codec' and pa local ASP state
 + data from skv [USP]

 PA => PM
 - use skv to publish state
 + local interface info [LAP]
 + USP info

SKV content:

'pd.<if>' results of DHCPv6 prefix delegation for a single interface
 format: {{prefix[, valid-lifetime]}, ...}

'iflist' should be a list of interfaces that have been seen _at some point_
(this can be updated by scripts, or ospf)

'ospf-lap' key will contain state local hosts should care about
 {{ifname=ifname, prefix=prefix}, ...} for every non-depracated prefix

** Figure why enabling debug breaks tests

** Write PA alg prototype in Lua

** Converted to strict.lua

* Done (24.9.+)

** Implement simple (len, binary-blob) low level i/o for SKV

** Implement JSON wrapping on top of that

** Write handlers for reading/writing JSON as needed

** Add whole 'listener' abstraction, deal with it (client+server)

 - {add,remove}_change_observer in skv

** SWIG ELSA + provide for Lua running inside BIRD

** Write AC LSA en-decode functionality in LUA
